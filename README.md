# TLDR
Fridge assistant project to help with making meals and using up ingredients in stock. I'm lazy at cooking so my plan is to have this eventually tell me what to make, when to make it, what ingredients I have and what ingredients I need.

# Planned
- Add expiry/sell-by dates with reminders
- Implement datetime module to help with sell-by dates
- Add a snacks list
- Add a shopping list for planned meals
- Add a GUI and move away from CLI
- Compress or split 'recipes' function
- Move from functions into classes/methods

# Completed
- Function that returns recipes that are a subset of the current ingredients
- Function to add new recipes
- Function to print recipes for a given meal
- Create save/load-able lists for ingredients/recipes
